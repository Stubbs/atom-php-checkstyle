#PHP Checkstyle

This plugin is for the Atom editor from GitHub, and aims to provide “Checkstyle” integration for PHP.

The plugin supports:

* PHP_CodeSniffer (phpcs)
* Linter (php -l)
* PHP Mess Detector (phpmd)
* Fix the issues using the PHP Coding Standards Fixer (php-cs-fixer) application

You can configure which commands above you want to execute, be it all of them, or just one of them, such as the linter.

The plugin renders the errors in the following formats, again configurable:

* List view
* Gutter view
* Status bar view
